Instructions for uploading of labs - upload pdf file separately. Can include ipynb and code in zip file, or individual files, but pdf MUST be separate.
(lose 0.5 marks if a pdf file isn't uploaded separately!). Show example on canvas to show what it looks like for us, and why we are requesting this.
Hand in JUST the questions from the assignment, not the entire lab. Preference to also include any .py or .yaml files that are required for your 
.ipynb to run - this way we can provide feedback on code and/or help debug code that is incorrect.

Update Assignment 6 for undergrads on Canvas

Worksheet 2 - needs more scaffolding, what are we trying to solve and why. (try to scaffold enough that we don't need to go through it afterwards). 

Lab 5 - some questions don't seem to make much sense with the default values in the .yaml files. Needs some re-thinking. 
Replace problem estimate in the assignment with a different problem. Give more scaffolding aroudn the predator problem. 

Mini-project 2 (undergrads). Add 'new equations for Daisy World' in list of requirements. Add rubric for this.

Add rubrics for all labs?

Add to Assignment 9 to make equivalent to other 10-mark assignments. Update solutions to Assignment 9 (Anya).

For grads (undergrads?):
Project proposal -> 5 marks
Project presentation -> 5 marks
Project -> 50 marks
