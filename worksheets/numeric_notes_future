Worksheet 2 - needs more scaffolding, what are we trying to solve and why. (try to scaffold enough that we don't need to go through it afterwards). 

Lab 5 - some questions don't seem to make much sense with the default values in the .yaml files. Needs some re-thinking. 
Replace problem estimate in the assignment with a different problem. Give more scaffolding aroudn the predator problem. 

Mini-project 2 (undergrads). Add 'new equations for Daisy World' in list of requirements. Add rubric for this.

Add rubrics for all labs?
